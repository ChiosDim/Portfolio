# My Portfolio 

  This is the source code for my personal portfolio site. I built it to showcase my work, share a bit about myself, and make it easy for people to reach out.

## What's Inside

- A clean, responsive interface that works on any device
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- My featured projects – web apps, interactive games, and an Unreal Engine 5 project 
- A working contact form that actually sends emails
- My social links and downloadable resume

## Tech Stack

I kept it simple but modern:

- **React** – because component-based UI just makes sense
- **Vite** – for that instant dev experience
- **Tailwind CSS** – I used to fight with CSS, now I don't
- **Framer Motion** – for buttery smooth animations
- **EmailJS** – handles the contact form without a backend
- **Vercel** – deployment that just works
